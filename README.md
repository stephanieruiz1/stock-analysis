## Overview of Project
Steve’s parents are passionate about green energy. They believe that as fossil fuels get used up, there will be more and reliance on alternative energy production. There are many forms of green energy to invest in, including hydroelectricity, wind energy, geothermal energy, and bioenergy. However, Steve’s parents haven’t done much research and have instead decided to invest all their money into Daqo New Energy Corporation a company that makes silicon wafer for solar panels. Steve wants to advise them properly so he wants to run some data and check DQ stocks in 2017 and 2018 to compare with other companies.
